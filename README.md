This project is a graphical Sudoku game implemented in Java using Swing

It features a 9x9 grid where users can solve a Sudoku puzzle by selecting numbers from a set of buttons. The puzzle and solution are predefined, and the user can fill in the grid by clicking on the empty cells and selecting numbers. The game tracks errors and displays a victory message once the puzzle is solved correctly.
